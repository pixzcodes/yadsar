            <h3>Welcome!</h3>
            <p> 
                Hello and welcome to YADSAR, a data structures and algorithms resource for 
                computer science students! Or really anyone interested in learning DSA for that matter.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea of this site is to provide easy access to descriptions and examples of common 
                data structures and algorithms as well as some visual examples to use as references.
                The content entries here are meant to be simple to understand and provide a point of reference,
                to be able to easily come back and find a specific piece of information quickly. Some information
                out there tends to be wordy and over explain everything, this website will not be one of those cases.
                The goal is to condense the information into what is important. 
            </p>
            <p><b>DSA is hard enough by itself. This website is here to lighten that load, not add to it. </b></p>
            <p>
                Everything on this website is hosted on GitHub under an MIT license, this includes the website itself.
                You can visit the repo <a href="https://github.com/pixzcodes/yadsar">here</a> if you're interested.
                Most of the examples will be programmed in Javascript for simplicity in the web development process.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the future I plan to add more and more content to the site to really flesh it out and 
                make it a real educational experience, but for now it might be a little bare.
            </p>
